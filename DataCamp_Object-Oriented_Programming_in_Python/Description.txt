Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that reduces the complexity of systems as is employs heavy re-usability of code. OOP leverages the concept of objects and classes. Objects may contain data (known as attributes, stored as instance or class variables) as well as procedures (defined as methods). Objects are generated from blueprints known as classes, which specify the attributes and methods to be generated at the time of object instantiation. This course introduces the internals of classes and the utilization of objects, as well as important object-oriented programming fundamentals such as inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.
