We start the course with an initial exploration of linear relationships, 
including some motivating examples of how linear models are used, 
and demonstrations of data visualization methods from matplotlib. 
We then use descriptive statistics to quantify the shape of our data and use correlation to quantify the strength of linear relationships between two variables.
