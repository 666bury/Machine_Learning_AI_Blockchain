Course Description
When done well, interacting with a computer through human language is incredibly powerful and also quite fun. 
Messaging and Voice-Controlled devices are the next big platforms, and conversational computing has a big role to play in creating engaging augmented and virtual reality experiences. 
This course will get you started on the path towards building such applications! There are a number of unique challenges to building these kinds of programs. 
The most obvious one is of course - how do I turn human language into machine instructions? In this course, you'll tackle this first with rule-based systems and then with machine learning. 
Some chat systems are designed to be useful, while others are just good fun. 
You will build one of each, and finally put everything together to make a helpful, friendly chatbot! And once you complete the course, you can learn how to connect your chatbot to Facebook Messenger!
